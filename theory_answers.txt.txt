Question 1
Define a computer and explain the difference between hardware and software, giving three examples of each.
A computer is an electronic device that accepts data (input), processes it according to instructions, stores it, and produces meaningful information (output).

Hardware refers to the physical, tangible parts of a computer that you can see and touch.
Keyboard
Monitor
Central processing unit(CPU)

Software refers to the programs or instructions that tell the computer what to do. Software cannot be touched physically.
Google chrome
Windows
Microsoft word

Question2
What is an operating system? 
An operating system is a system software that manages the overall operations of a computer and acts as an interface between the user and the computer hardware.

State two of its primary functions.
Resource management – it controls and allocates hardware resources such as the CPU, memory, and storage to different programs.
File and program management – it manages files on storage devices and allows users to run and control application programs.

Question 3
Compare Windows and Linux, highlighting any three differences.
Cost and Licensing
Windows is proprietary software and usually requires a paid license.
Linux is open-source and free to use, modify, and distribute.

User Interface
Windows has a graphical user interface that is easy for beginners and widely used on personal computers.
Linux offers different interfaces (called distributions or distros) and may require more technical knowledge, especially when using the command line.

Security and Stability
Windows is more commonly targeted by viruses and malware.
Linux is generally more secure and stable due to its permission system and open-source development.

Question 4
Explain the following terms:
File - A file is a collection of related data or information stored on a computer under a specific name. It can contain text, images, audio, video, or program data.
Folder - A folder (also called a directory) is a container used to organize and store files and sometimes other folders on a storage device, making it easier to manage and locate information.
File extension - A file extension is the part of a file name that comes after the dot (.) and indicates the type of file and the program used to open it. For example: .docx, .jpg, .mp3, .pdf.

Question 5
What is the command line, and why is it important for developers?
The command line (also called the command-line interface or CLI) is a text-based way of interacting with a computer by typing commands instead of using graphical icons and menus.

Question 6
Define the following internet-related terms:
Server - A server is a computer or system that provides services, resources, or data to other computers (called clients) over a network or the internet.

Browser - A browser is a software application used to access, view, and navigate websites on the internet. Examples include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.

IP Address - An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network. It identifies the device and allows it to communicate with other devices over the internet. Example: 192.168.1.1.

DNS (Domain Name System) - DNS is a system that translates human-friendly website names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses that computers use to locate servers on the internet.

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It encrypts the data being sent, which protects sensitive information like passwords, payments, or personal details from hackers.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used to transfer data over the internet, but it is not secure, meaning the information sent can be intercepted by others.

The main difference is that HTTPS provides security while HTTP does not.

Question 7
Describe the client–server model using a simple example. 
The client–server model is a way computers communicate on a network, where one computer (the server) provides resources or services, and another computer (the client) requests and uses them.
Example:
When you use a web browser like Google Chrome to visit a website:
Your browser is the client – it sends a request asking for a web page.
The website’s computer (web server) is the server – it receives the request and sends back the requested web page.

Question 8 
Differentiate between frontend and backend development.
Frontend Development:
Deals with everything the user sees and interacts with on a website or app.
Uses languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create layouts, buttons, forms, and visuals.
Example: The layout of a shopping website, the navigation menu, and the “Add to Cart” button.

Backend Development:
Deals with the server, database, and application logic that run behind the scenes.
Uses languages like Python, Java, PHP, or Node.js to manage data, user accounts, and business logic.
Example: Storing customer orders in a database, processing payments, and handling login credentials.

Question 9
Explain what a website, domain, and hosting are, and how they work together. 
Website: A website is a collection of web pages that contain information, images, videos, or interactive features. For example, Google.com or Wikipedia.org.

Domain: A domain is the human-readable address of a website that people type in a browser to access it, like www.google.com. It makes it easier to find a website instead of remembering its IP address.

Hosting: Hosting is the service that stores a website’s files (like text, images, and code) on a server so that the website can be accessed on the internet.

Question 10
Briefly describe the browser rendering process.
