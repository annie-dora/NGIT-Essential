Domain name: google.com

Protocol: HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)

What happens behind the scenes when you press Enter in the browser:

DNS lookup: Your browser first asks a DNS (Domain Name System) server to translate google.com into an IP address, which tells your computer where the server is located.

Establish connection: The browser establishes a connection with the Google server using HTTPS, which involves a secure handshake to encrypt data.

Send HTTP request: Your browser sends a request to the server asking for the webpage, like “GET /” for the homepage.

Server processing: The Google server receives the request, processes it, and prepares the response. This might involve fetching data, running scripts, or reading cached files.

Send response: The server sends back the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images that make up the webpage.

Browser renders page: Your browser interprets the code, loads styles and scripts, and displays the webpage for you to interact with.

Additional requests: The browser may make extra requests for images, videos, or ads embedded in the page, repeating the process as needed.
