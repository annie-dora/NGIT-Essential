Due to the fact that websites are powered by computer systems, 
web developers must have a solid understanding of computers and
 operating systems. An understanding of operating systems aids 
developers in efficiently managing data, installing applications, 
and resolving issues. A developer can better understand what happens 
when a user views a website by having a solid understanding of the web's
 workings, including ideas like servers, browsers, and DNS. Fixing issues 
when a website fails to load or behaves strangely is much simpler with 
this knowledge. Additionally, it aids programmers in creating safer and 
more effective code. Without knowing these fundamentals, a developer could 
find it difficult to determine the root of technological problems. 
In general, coding becomes more significant and efficient when one 
possesses fundamental information.
